# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a company using its user data. Customer churn, or customer attrition, refers to the loss of clients or customers. It is a critical metric for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers.

In this project, I have utilized a dataset in CSV format which was imported into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis. The process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the data is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to extract valuable insights and understand underlying patterns.
3. **Machine Learning**: Using supervised machine learning techniques to build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

The ultimate goal of this project is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and develop strategies to improve customer retention.
